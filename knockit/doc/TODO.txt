Dedup FFTs
- If this proves impossible, move Recorder to ISampleProvider
Move to IWaveProviders everywhere - shouldn't need a SampleProvider
User-settable warning level
Auto-detect and tune to knock freq (two or more peaks at x & 2x where 4k < x < 10k say)
investigate log scale for spectrum - knock easier to see?
Persist settings (win location, freq & epsilon, devices)
Absility to name and save setups, provide some defaults, e.g. SR20, 2JZ
Ability to turn on and off 1st, 2nd, 3rd harmonic
Make changing devices at run-time work. If devices unset in settings file, prompt up-front on first run.
